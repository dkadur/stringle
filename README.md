# About
Stringle is a Python clone of the famous online game "Wordle" with over 5000 unique words to guess.

# Running
Simply run stringle.py and make sure words.txt (the list of 5000+ words) is in the same directory.

# Instructions
The instructions are the same as the original version minus the interactive keyboard.

You have 6 tries to guess a 5 letter word. Input your guess by typing on your keyboard. Use the "backspace" button to delete letters from your guess. Hit "enter" to finalize a guess. 

Once a guess has been entered, colors will be assigned to the letters in your guess:<br/><br/>
-Green: Correct letter, correct position<br/>
-Yellow: Correct letter, incorrect position<br/>
-Gray: Incorrect letter<br/>

Enjoy!
